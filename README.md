This project is a simple Image Gallery CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. It allows users to upload, view, edit, and delete images. The app demonstrates basic CRUD functionalities.

**Features:**
- User Authentication
- Upload new images
- View all uploaded images in a gallery format
- Edit image details
- Delete images from the gallery


## NOTE: It's not the best practice to include API keys in the code on GitHub.
## In case you want to run this code, I uploaded .env on Brightspace.
